## Overview
Utilized unsupervised learning and clustering algorithm to group mulitple cryptocurrencies together.

## Deliverable 1
Cleaned the crypto dataset and prepared it for PCA. Removed all cryptocurrencies that are not currently trading and removed all rows with any null values. 

## Deliverable 2
Performed Principal Component Analysis algorithm to reduce the DataFrame from deliverable 1 down to 3 principal components.

## Deliverable 3
Utilizing an elbow curve the K-means algorithm was used on the DataFrame created in deliverable 2 to create clusters on the cryptocurrencies.

## Deliverable 4
Created a 3D scatter plot to visualize the different groups of cryptocurrencies and a final table combining the DataFrames from deliverable 2 and 3.
